CHECK-IN: Milestone 2
==========

Questions
-------------
- Did any of your answers to Milestone 1 change (particularly the Additional Questions, your idea for your site, or team members)? Write the numbers for the questions whose answers have changed, and their new answers.

Not really.

- Which features are implemented. To what extent are they complete?

Feels feed: main functionality done. Additional features, such as feels filters by emotion and date, to be added.
Splash/signup/login page: exists, just needs to be worded better.

- Are there any features you wanted to include in your MVP from Milestone 1 that are not complete? If so, which are they?

The personal emotional records/stats page, while not essential for the MVP, would be a great feature to have as well.

- What additional features do you wish to implement? How far along on those features are you?

Personal emotional record/stats page (as mentioned in the previous question): mocked up, to be implemented.

- What technologies are you using for the back-end? Include any frameworks if relevant.

Meteor
MongdoDB

- What technologies are you using for the front-end? Include Javascript frameworks such as jQuery, templating frameworks such as Handlebars.js, and other client-side frameworks such as Ember.js or Backbone.js.

jQuery
Masonry.js
Handlebars.js
Semantic UI

- What is the main browser you are targeting? Must be one of our supported browsers.

Chrome

- What implementation unknown / risks are you still facing? Consider this an exercise of imagination, not a test of confidence.

Making the website as responsive/fast as possible, especially when querying the database, is a constant challenge.
Database security issues need to be dealt with.
Trolls. (Which is why we're very cautious about implementing any features that allow users to interact with each other.)
