CHECK-IN: Milestone 1
==========

User research
-------------
- What problem does your application address, and how does your application address it?

Our application gives students a supportive and pretty place to vent their emotions, plus it gives a community a way to check in on and visualize its emotional state. 

- What are the killer features of your application?

The main feature here is the emotional grid, which updates dynamically with new emotion submissions, featured on the front page. This allows one to quickly gauge the ‘emotional’ weather of the community at any given time.
With user accounts, one can also see the emotional history of themselves, using various forms of data visualization for mood versus time.

- Identify and briefly describe your target demographic. Who do you envision using your site?

College students. Our MVP will target MIT students. Anyone who as an @mit.eduemail will be able to view all the posts by other MIT students, as well as view their personal post history. The target demographic is ideal for both posters and lurkers, as both can use the site to vent frustrations/share feelings and gauge ‘emotional weather.’

- Develop at least one use case for your site. This should be a list or table demonstrating a sequence of user actions and website responses that occur when a user attempts to complete a core task on your site. Make sure to indicate the task the user is trying to complete.

Task: Post a public, anonymous check-in.
1. User opens the website, with a submission sidebar and a grid of colored squares.
2. User clicks into the text field, and types a post.
3. User clicks a button to tag that post with a specific emotion.
4. User clicks a submission button.
5. On the grid, a new colored square appears and glows and reorganizes the grid with the corresponding color.

Site Design
-----------
- Think hard about your most complicated page. 
What are the important features of this page? 

The posts feed: This is a grid of colored squares, with each square representing a post, and each square representing a color.
	
Post submission: Post submit will be on a side-bar, in the form of a text-field, with a grid of possible emotion tags beneath it, as well as a submit button.

Single post view: Clicking on a square in the grid will zoom into that square, and reveal the post associated with it.

- What usability problems may come up? 

It might not be immediately evident what each block represents, or that each grid in the square is clickable.
- For your most important page:
Draw out, by hand, three different designs for this page. Scan these for your submission.
Make a list of 3 pros and 3 cons for each design.
Pick the best design and mock it up using an image editing program (i.e. Photoshop or Gimp) or using HTML/CSS. Submit a screenshot of this mockup.

Minimal Viable Product
----------------------
- What features do you plan to implement? How critical are they to the proper functioning of your application?

The main feature that would be most important to implement would be the home page with a post submission field and a grid of colored squares that update in real-time with new submissions.

- What features do you plan to leave out? How critical are they to the proper functioning of your application?

The feature we would leave out is the personal emotional data page, for visualizing personal emotional data over time. This feature would not be critical to the proper functioning of the website.
- Are there any other aspects of your application that are reduced in your MVP? Examples including limited fake datasets, stylistic concerns, security concerns, etc.

For the MVP, we would most likely concern ourselves less with data security, as we would want to remain anonymity in the public posts but keep posts with specific accounts.

Additional Questions
---------------------
- Please answer the following questions. Please be succinct as possible.
Who is in your team? You may list at most 3 people (4 if you are not competing in the main division). For each member list the full legal name, .edu e-mail, school, major(s), year, and graduate/undergraduate status. For each team member, also indicate whether they are registered to take the class for credit.

Merry Mou, mmou@mit.edu, MIT, Course 6, Undergrad Sophomore, for credit

Edwin Zhang, ehzhang@mit.edu, MIT, Course 6, Undergrad Sophomore, for credit

- Which of the themes does your application match best? Be as brief as you can. 

Theme 2: Health & Nutrition. Our app targets emotional health. 

- What technology do you plan to use for your server-side programming (e.g. PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc)?

Meteor (Javascript, Node)
    
- What risks do you envision preventing you from successfully implementing your idea? Consider this an exercise of imagination, not a test of confidence.

Authentication should be really easy for the user, and simple, ideally one time login.

The UI/UX decision will make or break this product.

- Are you planning to participate in the competition? If so, are you competing in the main division or the rookie division? Your answer will solely be used for planning purposes.

Yes we would like to compete in the main division.
